A collection of tools for dealing with Chromium development.

The Chromium depot_tools suite contains many tools to assist/augment
the Chromium development environment. The tools may be downloaded by
checking out the git repository[1].

There are two primary categories of tools. Some of these tools are
essential to the development flow, in the sense that you cannot
successfully develop Chromium without them.

Other tools are merely helper tools. Not required, but they can
substantially ease the development workflow.
