chericat is a standalone tool that runs on CheriBSD.  It
can be used by either attaching to a running process or parsing a
coredump to produce capability-related data, which is stored in a local
SQL database.  The data can then be queried to retrieve information
regarding the capabilities created at that snapshot.
